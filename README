#+TITLE: Docker recipes for Grammatical Framework images

this repository contains =Dockerfiles= that build GF
images. documentation is either in the =Dockerfiles= themselves or in
a README in the appropriate directory.

the images are built upon the official [[https://hub.docker.com/_/debian/][Debian image]] or the [[https://hub.docker.com/_/haskell/][haskell
image]].

* running
the images do not specify =CMD= or =ENTRYPOINT= directives, so you are
free to choose yours. good choices are good ol' =bash= and (of course)
=gf= (with any of its flags).

you probably want to use the =--volume= flag to add your grammar to
the image at runtime, like so:
: docker run -it -v ~/my-grammars-repo:/home/gfer/ [gf_image] [entrypoint]
